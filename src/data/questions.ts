    question: "What is the difference between correlation and causation?",
    options: [
      "They are different terms for the same statistical relationship",
      "Correlation means one variable causes the other, while causation is a weaker relationship",
      "Correlation shows a statistical relationship between variables, but doesn't imply one causes the other",
      "Causation can exist without correlation"
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Correlation indicates that two variables have a statistical relationship or pattern, but correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables move together doesn't mean one causes the other - they could both be affected by a third variable or their relationship could be coincidental."

    question: "What is a materialized view in SQL and when would you use it?",
    options: [
      "A view that shows only material data (numbers and text) instead of binary data",
      "A physical copy of the data resulting from a view's query, stored for faster access",
